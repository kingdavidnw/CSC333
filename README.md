Optimization Solver
Project Overview
This project solves various Optimization Problems using Python, focusing on maximizing or minimizing an objective (e.g., profit or cost) under specific constraints. The solutions leverage Pythonâ€™s scipy library and are run interactively in Jupyter Notebooks.

Objective
The goal is to demonstrate how to:

Maximize or minimize an objective function (e.g., profit, cost).
